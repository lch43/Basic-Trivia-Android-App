# Basic Trivia Android App
 
##This is my first time experimenting with Android mobile app development.
###Since this was just a small project made in less than a day to get familiar with Android app development, this project will likely not move much forward from the current status it is in.

##What is this app?
###The app is a trivia app that requests questions from "Open Trivia Database" and displays the questions as a text view. Four buttons are filled with text of possible answers with the correct answer being placed on a randomly chosen button. When you answer by clicking your choice, you are told whether or not you are correct and which answer was deemed to be correct. It is currently set up in a way that allows questions to be repeated, so make sure you pay attention to which answer was correct.
